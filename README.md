🌦️ **Weather App – Hackathon Practice Project**
Hey! This is my simple Weather App I built for Hackathon practice.
I made it to quickly check the weather of any city in a fun and easy way. It’s built with Python and Flask, and I used a free API called wttr.in to get live weather updates.

->Enter any city and instantly see the current weather

->Clean design with input boxes and a background image

->Beginner-friendly, perfect for Hackathon practice or learning Flask






**Features**

->Type a city name → see the weather instantly ☀️⛅🌧️

->Simple, responsive design with nice input boxes

->Works locally and can be deployed later
